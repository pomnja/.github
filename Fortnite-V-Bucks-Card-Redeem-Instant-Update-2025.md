## What are Fortnite V-Bucks Cards?

## How to Redeem a Fortnite V-Bucks Card: Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Get Your Fortnite V-Bucks Card
V-Bucks cards are available in many retail stores, both in physical formats and as digital codes that can be sent to your email. You can purchase these cards online or in stores like Walmart, GameStop, and Best Buy.

### Step 2: Access the Redemption Website
To redeem your Fortnite V-Bucks, head over to the official Epic Games website. Make sure to log in with the correct account linked to your Fortnite game. If you're on a gaming console, you can also redeem through the console's online store.

### Step 3: Enter the Card Code
Once you’re logged in, locate the "Redeem Code" option, which is typically found in the account settings. Enter the code from the back of the card or in the email you received for digital purchases.

### Step 4: Confirm the Redemption
After entering the code, confirm the redemption by following the on-screen prompts. Once confirmed, your account will be credited with the V-Bucks immediately, allowing you to spend them within Fortnite.
