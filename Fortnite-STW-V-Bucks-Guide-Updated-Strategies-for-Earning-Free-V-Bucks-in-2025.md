## How Fortnite STW V-Bucks Work

V-Bucks, or Vindertech Bucks, are the in-game currency used in Fortnite. They are essential for buying various cosmetic items in Fortnite, such as skins, gliders, pickaxes, emotes, and more. In Fortnite Save the World mode, players can earn V-Bucks through a variety of methods, and here’s how it works:

### Earning V-Bucks in Fortnite STW

Unlike Fortnite Battle Royale, where V-Bucks can be earned primarily through Battle Pass rewards or purchased through real money, Fortnite Save the World offers several in-game methods to earn V-Bucks.

1. **Daily Login Rewards**: Players who log in daily are rewarded with V-Bucks as part of the Daily Login Rewards. These can range from 50 V-Bucks to a few hundred depending on the day and your login streak.

2. **Mission Rewards**: Completing missions in Fortnite STW often rewards you with V-Bucks. These missions can be found in various zones within the game, and they come in different difficulty levels.

3. **Challenges and Event Missions**: Participating in weekly challenges or limited-time event missions is another way to earn V-Bucks. Some challenges reward players with a significant number of V-Bucks.

4. **Survival Mode**: Survival mode is a challenging gameplay mode where you must fend off waves of enemies. Completing these survival missions and achieving high scores often results in V-Bucks as rewards.

## Updated V-Bucks Earning Strategies for 2025

As Fortnite continues to evolve, the methods for earning V-Bucks in STW also change. Here are some updated strategies for earning V-Bucks in 2025, taking into account recent game updates and trends.

### 1. **Focus on Higher Difficulty Missions**

In 2025, Fortnite STW has added new high-difficulty missions that reward players with more V-Bucks. These missions often require more coordination and skill, but the rewards are worth it. Look for missions in higher-level zones and participate in challenging Storm Shield Defense missions to maximize your V-Bucks payout.

### 2. **Make Use of New Event Passes and Seasonal Events**

Epic Games has introduced seasonal event passes in Fortnite STW. These event passes offer exclusive missions and rewards, including V-Bucks, skins, and other cosmetics. Make sure to participate in seasonal events like Halloween, Winterfest, and Summer Splash to get bonus V-Bucks from event missions.

### 3. **Complete Daily and Weekly Challenges**

The Daily and Weekly Challenges are one of the most consistent ways to earn V-Bucks in Fortnite STW. These challenges can include tasks like defeating a certain number of husks, completing specific missions, or participating in survival challenges. Completing these challenges not only rewards you with V-Bucks but also helps you level up your account.

### 4. **Upgrade Your Storm Shield Defenses**

Upgrading your Storm Shield and progressing through Storm Shield Defense missions is a key strategy for earning V-Bucks. Each completed defense mission gives you a V-Bucks reward, and as you progress to higher levels, the rewards increase. Keep upgrading your Storm Shield to unlock tougher missions with better V-Bucks payouts.
